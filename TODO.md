# TODO

## Important

- [ ] theres also a feature in the new practicemod called no checkpoint touch that would be cool as well

## Less Important

- [ ] is it possible to make a scene where you just enter the kingdom? with all the cutscenes and texts  
    - [x] text  
    - [ ] fix cutscene skips  
- [ ] allow moving menu to different corners

## Hard

- [ ] refresh seed & deep woods nut  
- [ ] refresh shards  
- [ ] refresh doors  
- [ ] timer for every splice  
- [ ] having the multimoon spawn at the start of every kingdom, or a way to reload stage like you got the multimoon  
- [ ] Could you shorten story moon cutscenes and make the story moons not as messy too  
- [ ] all persisting states should have the ability to be reset  
- [ ] is it possible to speed up the warp animation? if so you it would be great if you put that in
